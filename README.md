# Cadillac F1: Driving Style Analytics Tool

[Guide to My Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BunsD4oBivE5Oaoi5o8yKeI-t56p413B6HScvpEkVn8/edit?usp=sharing)

## Business Need  
In the high-stakes environment of Formula 1, performance optimization hinges on understanding not only the car, but the driver's interaction with it. While lap time remains the ultimate metric, it is influenced by numerous external factors such as car performance, tire compound, track conditions, traffic, and more.  

## Objective  
To isolate and understand driver behavior, Cadillac F1 requires a telemetry-driven analytics tool that can cluster drivers by driving style, independent of lap time.  

## My Contribution
- Piloted the senior capstone project **a semester early**.  
- Built **driver telemetry analytics tool** using Python, Jupyter, Matplotlib, and Streamlit.  
- Implemented **clustering and anomaly detection models** to categorize driving styles and flag outlier laps.  
- Produced **insights on braking, throttle, and tire wear** patterns.  
- Laid foundation for future teams to extend analysis and integrate results into F1 workflows.

## Key Takeaways
- Delivered a **full pipeline from telemetry to insights**.  
- Showcased **analytics, ML, and visualization** for real-world problems.  
- Early capstone demonstrates **initiative and project ownership**.
